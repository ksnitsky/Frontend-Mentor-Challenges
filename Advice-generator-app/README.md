## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor for CSS
- BEM (I hope I used it correctly)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for developing and building a project
- Vanilla JS (ES6) for getting data from [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)
- VSCode

### What I learned

This was my first experience with ES6 and async functions. Also first time working with API from frontend. 

Learned how to use Vite as a project build tool.

### Useful resources

- [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import) - Made me realize not to use @import to include other .scss files.
- [Fetch API JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - Helped me figure out how to get data from api


## Note

- Perhaps the solution will look bad on screens with a height below 340px
